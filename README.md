# DSW-MLtest
Welcome to the Loan Default Prediction Model repository! This project is part of the Data Science Wizards Campus Hiring challenge, where we aim to develop a classification model to predict loan repayment behavior, specifically identifying potential defaulters and non-defaulters.

##Various files and their uses:

1. eda.ipynb : Used to perform exploratory data analysis on the given data
2. Different_Model_Evaluation.ipynb : In this file we explored total of 5 models of various types to see which one would be best for our usecase, we shortlist 2 for further processing in model_.ipynb file
3. model_.ipynb In this file we prepare class object based code for the 2 shortlisted model and compare their eval matrix and choose one for finalizing
4. model_selection.ipynb : Contains our final model
